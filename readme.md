# A little something for CSS3 fanboys.

Works only in WebKit browsers, as these are the only ones supporting 3D transforms.

However, this is a pretty awesome effect. Very much inspired by [this piece](http://dribbble.com/shots/324781-Photofold) on Dribbble.

## Room for improvement.

One thing I failed to find a solution to, is the fact that part 1 and 2 overlap during the animation. I think we need some math skills to solve this one. I guess it's because part 2 is having both rotation and translation done to it, it's animation runs twice as fast as part 1, which only has the rotation.

Anyone with an idea to solve this?
